% rl feedback loop and reward system
  % Reinforcement learning is a type of control system that attempts to execute tasks described by minimizing manually set cost functions using optimization algorithms or learning algorithms. In the case of deep reinforcement learning, the controller is modeled using deep neural networks and the cost function is minimized using gradient descent algorithms.
  % Reinforcement learning divides control systems into an agent and an environment. The agent acts the controller of the system that inspects its environment's state and sends output signals, or actions, that affect the environment, creating a feedback loop between the two modules.
