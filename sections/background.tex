\section{Background}
\subsection{Head-Bobbing in Pigeons}
% observation of head stabilization
% optokinetic
% redefined optokinetic
% hypothesis on predator-prey usage
% highlight focus on slow locomotion

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
% rl feedback loop and reward system
% using reward as a cost function / constraint / task def
% PPO
% PPO advantage regarding gradient step
% PPO as baseline for numerous experiments (as opposed to SAC)
