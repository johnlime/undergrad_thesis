\chapter{Analysis}
% head wiggles relatively in the same position
% did not need to constantly thrust head forward

% may need a state machine-like mechanism for replication of head-bob
% hierarchical reinforcement learning; hierarchical control system

% head goes backwards during forward locomotion
% lack of muscular strain penalty? -> incremental modeling
