\chapter{Introduction}
% Biomimetics is a research field that attempts to replicate biological phenomena, such as behaviors exhibited by animals, using methods seen in engineering
% models developed for biomimicry can be applied to developments of bio-inspired robotics
% bio-inspired robotics solve difficult engineering problems by observing biological organisms that solve similar problems
  % bipedal locomotion using proposed models of control systems in bipedal creatures
    % balancing the body without falling

% head-bobbing is a behavior unique to small birds, mainly pigeons
% despite the name, head-bobbing mostly consists of stabilizing their heads into a single location while occasionally altering it
% their abilities to lock their limbs may garner interest in the field of camera stabilization and similar research in optical engineering due to their similarities
% preliminary research have proposed possible functionalities behind such behavior, mainly consisting of gathering information of surrounding objects using the retina
  % however to our knowledge, no physical model that can replicate such have been proposed

% reinforcement learning
