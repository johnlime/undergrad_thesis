\subsection{Head-Bobbing in Pigeons}
% Head-bobbing = Head stabilization
  % Despite the appearance of a horizontal oscillation, the time lapse of the "head-bob" behavior in pigeons consists of stabilizing the location and orientation of the head and altering them when they become unreachable. Such are dubbed as the hold phase and the thrust phase \cite{frost_1978}.
% Head stabilization used for stabilizing vision
  % Several hypothesis regarding the functionalities of such behavior have been proposed, all of which that we focus in this research suggest that the hold phase is utilized for stabilizing vision.
% Introduce 4 Hypothesis
% How each of the 4 hypothesis diverge
  % What this explains
  % What the shortcomings are
