\section{Preliminary Research}
\subsection{Modeling biological phenomena}
% Robotics and Animals paper
  % Discusses pros and limitations of robotics as biological modeling
  % Algorithmic model vs Robotic model
    % Algorithmic models inferior to robotic models
    % Where can we use algorithmic models
    % Connect to this pigeon research
  % Learning model uses
    % Examples
    % Tie into current research
  % Incremental models
    % Method to tackle discrepancies between complexity of biological phenomena and its model
    % Tie into current research

\subsection{Head-Bobbing in Pigeons}
% Head-bobbing = Head stabilization
  % Despite the appearance of a horizontal oscillation, the time lapse of the "head-bob" behavior in pigeons consists of stabilizing the location and orientation of the head and altering them when they become unreachable. Such are dubbed as the hold phase and the thrust phase \cite{frost_1978}.
% Head stabilization used for stabilizing vision
  % Mainly 2 hypothesis regarding the functionalities of such behavior have been proposed \cite{frost_1978} \cite{davies_1988}.
  Both hypothesis suggest that the hold phase is utilized for stabilizing vision.
% Introduce 2 Hypothesis
% How each of the 2 hypothesis diverge
  % What this explains
  % What the shortcomings are
% Side note: 2 more hypothesis mentioned in the two papers that we are probably going to ignore
