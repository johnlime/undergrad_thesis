\section{Head-Bobbing in Pigeons}
% Head-bobbing = Head stabilization
  % Despite the appearance of a horizontal oscillation, the time lapse of the "head-bob" behavior in pigeons consists of stabilizing the location and orientation of the head and altering them when they become unreachable. Such are dubbed as the hold phase and the thrust phase \cite{frost_1978}.
% Head stabilization used for stabilizing vision
  % Several hypothesis regarding the functionalities of such behavior have been proposed. 
% Introduce 4 Hypothesis
% How each of the 4 hypothesis diverge
  % What this explains
  % What the shortcomings are
