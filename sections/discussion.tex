\chapter{Discussion}
% did not need to constantly thrust head forward

% may need a state machine-like mechanism for replication of head-bob
  %
% hierarchical control system
  % hierarchical reinforcement learning should be used for modeling the control system with this hypothesis
% pattern generating module or functionality, such as central pattern generators seen in the spinal cortex

% head goes downwards during forward locomotion
% lack of muscular strain penalty? (-> incremental modeling)

% higher details, such as an addition of muscular physics, for progression in incremental modeling
% muscular simulation and their placements upon the skeletal model may lead to more stabilization? (cite Geijtenbeek)
